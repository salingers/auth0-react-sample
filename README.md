# Auth0 + React + API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, React and an API that you're going to be developing. That API can be in any language.

To see the example working, just go to [http://auth0.github.io/auth0-react/examples/redirect-lock-with-api/](http://auth0.github.io/auth0-react/examples/redirect-lock-with-api/)

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install` in this project folder.
2. run `npm run build` to transpile the jsx files into js files in this project root.
2. run `npm install -g serve`
3. run `serve`

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
To modify the React elements, just edit the respective `.jsx` file in the `jsx` folder, and run `npm run build` to update the transpiled files.
